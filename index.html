            <h2> About Me: </h2>
            <p>I have bounced around jobs ever since I left high school and have been looking for something to bring more purpose and meaning into my life. With my love for computers and a hunger to learn more, I figured starting a career as a software engineer would be a perfect fit for me.</br>
            <p> I grew up playing baseball and became the captain of my team during my high school years, and the team aspect of the sport appealed to me which is another reason I am interested in programming. Nothing beats putting your heads together as a team to achieve a common goal.</p>

            <p> Other things I am interested in:</p>
            <ul> 
            <li> Cars </li>
            <li> Movies </li>
            <li> Working Out </li>
            <li> Music </li>
              </ul>
